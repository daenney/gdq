[Games Done Quick (GDQ)](https://gamesdonequick.com/) is a regular
speedrunning event that collects money for charity. The event is incredibly
fun, especially if you enjoy seeing your favourite games torn to shreds by
amazing runners and supported with great commentary and prizes to win.

This repo contains a Go library and CLI for working with the GDQ schedule. It uses the
[Tracker API](https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/donation-tracker) to retrieve
the data.

There is also a companion [Matrix](https://matrix.org) bot over at
[GDQBot](https://github.com/daenney/gdqbot).

## Installation

### CLI
There are prebuilt binaries available for every release from v1.0.0 onwards. You

### Library

```sh

```

## Building

You can `go get` the library, or `git clone` and then run a `go build` followed
by a `go test ./...` to ensure everything is OK.

You can build the CLI using `go build -trimpath -o gdqcli cmd/gdqcli/*.go` or
install it directly using `go install github.com/daenney/gdq/v3/cmd/gdqcli`. See
`go help install` for where the binaries will end up.
